MDataGrid library adds filtering to the Flex 4 Spark DataGrid.
It also provides the CSV export functionality.

This project is based on my previous MX DataGrid filtering implementation available at http://code.google.com/p/reusable-fx/
Not all the feature has been ported to Spark components yet so it still depends on MX.
